rust-jvm
========

A basic experiment about implementing the JVM in Rust (http://www.rust-lang.org), maybe inspired by
[jvm.go](https://github.com/zxh0/jvm.go)

Current status: `WIP`

Documentation: http://kokakiwi.github.io/rust-jvm/jvm/index.html

Currently, the library can only parse almost all the Java .class file and print it.

The `rjvm` executable only take a class name, parse it and print it.
